#why do we need /16 CIDR for vpc?
because it gives around 65536 ips which is useful for large projects
CIDR block = a range of IPs like 10.0.0.0/16

/16 ➝ means 16 fixed bits, rest can vary

2^(32 - 16) = 2^16 = 65,536 IP addresses

#what about subnets then?
we need subnets to separate resources based on purpose or access level.
From your main VPC CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, you're carving out smaller subnet blocks like:
10.0.1.0/24 → 256 IPs
10.0.2.0/24 → 256 IPs
These are subnets — smaller slices from your big VPC network
